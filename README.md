## Overview

The Orcish AI Next.js Framework is a powerful tool that leverages the capabilities of OpenAI API, OpenAI's advanced language models, to integrate AI functionalities seamlessly into your Next.js applications. With this framework, you can easily harness the power of AI to generate text, images, and text to speech based on your specified input.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To begin, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Configuration

Create a copy of the provided `.env.example` file and name it `.env`. Fill in the required OpenAI API Key in the newly created `.env` file, and Better Auth variables if you're going to use authentication:

`cp .env.example .env`

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=your_better_auth_secret
BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000

NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000

NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_stripe_publishable_key
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=your_stripe_secret_key

DATABASE_URL=your_neon_database_connection_string or your_postgres_database_connection_string
```

Make sure to replace placeholder values with your actual API keys, and keep them safe!

# Development Server

After installing the dependencies, and adding configuration variables run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
